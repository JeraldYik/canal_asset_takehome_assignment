SocialMediaData(id=11, source=reddit, data_id=1hmhjoq, text=<Tangem Ring Wallet Reviews?> Hey everyone,

I’m looking into getting a new cold wallet and came across the Tangem Ring Wallet. The form factor looks really interesting, especially since it’s wearable, which could add convenience compared to traditional USB-like devices like Ledger or Trezor. However, I’m curious about real-world experiences with this wallet rather than relying on YouTube reviews, many of which seem paid or sponsored.

Does anyone here use the Tangem Ring Wallet?

I’m trying to understand how well it stacks up in terms of security, ease of use, and reliability over time. Any honest feedback would be super helpful!, author_id=Fun-Technology-1371, data_created_at=2024-12-26 05:15:29, input_data=cryptocurrency)
